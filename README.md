Guess Shrek's Number

I made this game as a final project for my CHE120 project!

It was a creative way to showcase the skills I learned throughout the course, obtain new abilities in Python, and apply them to Pygame. 

The task of this project was to take a well-known game, change some rules and apply some graphics. My group members and I took the game "Guess The Number" that was based on CLUI and updated using graphics from the well known game "Shrek" to make a a GUI-based game. This was done through the use of buttons, text displayed and updated on a screen, while loops, functions for game functionality, and for loops to detect game events.

# Shrek-Themed Guess The Number Game

This game is a Shrek-themed take on the classic "Guess the Number" game. It features:
- **Graphics**: Shrek-inspired visuals.
- **Game Logic**: Python code to manage gameplay and events.
- **GUI**: Built with Pygame for buttons and text updates.

## Game Rules
1. Select a difficulty level by clicking one of the boxes. For each level, you are given a different
amount of guesses:
- Easy: 15 guesses
- Medium: 10 guesses
- Hard: 5 guesses
2. Guess the number between 1 and 50 that Shrek is thinking of. If guessed incorrectly, you will be eaten!
